[My personal website](https://www.sarabatevik.no) is a website meant to display my personal projects and experience. I hosted this website on [GitHub](https://github.com/sassybunsthebun/sarabatevik). It is made with HUGO. Since I already made a website in HUGO before ([My hobby website](https://www.sassybuns.no)), it was easy to get into. I am happy with the fact it only took me a few hours to get the design how I wanted.
