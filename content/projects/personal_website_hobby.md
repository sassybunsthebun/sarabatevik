[My hobby website](https://www.sassybuns.no) is a website meant to display my personal crafts as well as provide general info. I hosted this website on [GitHub](https://github.com/sassybunsthebun/SassyBuns). It is made with HUGO, the same framework as the current website. It includes my bigger crafting projects. It was fun to get into HUGO, after trying a bit with the templates. When I got into the process of setting up HUGO, I found the website design process simple and intuitive. I am happy to have this website, and it is fun to work with.
