I followed a tutorial for making snake in Godot, and made my own graphics to complement the design. Instead of a snake, it is a long dragon, and instead of eating apples, it is eating pizza. Designing a game in Godot was both fun and challenging, as it was my first time trying to program in a game engine. It was fun to make a playable game, and to design the game with my own twist, such as adding a dragon growl instead of a biting apple sound. It was a fun little side project to try out Godot.
