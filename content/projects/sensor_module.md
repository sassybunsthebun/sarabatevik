Summer 2025 I worked for New Gaze, developing a technology to assist blind anlow vision people with navigation in their daily life. I worked to create a sensor module with sensors needed for the project. The sensors and futher details cannot be discussed in greater details to keep the company development ideas safe. At the time, New Gaze had three people working on the project, where I had most responsibility over the sensor module, and made this module myself. I got input from the others, but did the final product myself. I am happy to have been able to have so much responsibility at work and to have made a sensor module that works well, with short response time.
