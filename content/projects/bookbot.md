This [book bot](https://github.com/sassybunsthebun/bookbot) is a Python program that can give statistical data about a given book, such as word and character usage. The book bot was made by following a [boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/courses/build-bookbot-python) guide. It was a very simple project, but a nice memory jog to ensure I don't forget python syntax.
