This [asteroids game](https://github.com/sassybunsthebun/asteroids) is a Python program where you can play the classic game "Asteroids" made with PyGame using object-oriented programming. The asteroids game was made by following a [boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/courses/build-asteroids-python) guide. The graphics are heavily simplified, but it turned out to be a fun little game to play. I found it most difficult to get into the mindset and workflow of game design in this project, as I had done little of it previously, but after a bit of research I found it rather nice and intuitive. It was a nice challenge, and I was very proud of making something enjoyable to ply in the end.
