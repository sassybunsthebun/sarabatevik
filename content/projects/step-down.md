During the IELS2031 course our class got an introduction to PCB design as well as knowledge about how component choices impact the circuit design. We created a 5V to 1V step down converter made to carry a load of up to 2A over a load resistor. Through two iterations and testing, we managed to create a design that best fit the given requirements for the course. This PCB was made with SMD components and designed in Altium. It was a fun challenge to learn Altium, as it had some of the design workflow elements that I was used to, but it is also a robust program that is capable of much more than the simple features I had previously learned. It didn't take too long for me to pass that initial learning curve, and after that the program was rather enjoyable to work with. I liked the blue design of the PCB, as well as the fact that I added an outline of the dragon PCB and my personal logo.
