During the IELS2003 course our class got an introduction to PCB design as well as knowledge about how component choices impact the circuit design. We created a heart rate monitor/ECG monitor that wirelessly transmits heart rate measurements to a website. Through two iterations and testing, I managed to create a design that best fit the given requirements for the course. This PCB was made with through-hole components soldered by us and designed in Altium. It was a fun challenge to learn Altium, as it had some of the design workflow elements that I was used to, but it is also a robust program that is capable of much more than the simple features I had previously learned. It didn't take too long for me to pass that initial learning curve, and after that the program was rather enjoyable to work with. I like the red PCB with the silkscreen heart, I thought it was a fun addition to add to an ECG monitor. I also added a LED connected to the ESP32 that I programmed to pulsate in the heart rate of the user, which I also liked a lot!
